## About Me
My interest in the field of computer science is always growing. Throughout the last few years, I have been learning and dreaming of all the different areas I can work in, and all the diffrent goals I can achieve. I am devoted to reaching those goals. I won't settle for being just one more Computer Scientist. If I joined this field, it's because I'm gonna live in it, and breath it, and I will reach high. I love playing videogames, and trying to figure out how developers worked the logic of making every level work together with the other. I also like to analyze the websites and applications that I use on my day to day, and try to understand the logic behind it, and think about in what possible ways could these programs be improved.
